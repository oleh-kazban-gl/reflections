When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I'am working with team, in order to keep all changes of other users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	There might be conflicts we should deal with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Branches are used as different types of one instance (that is: production, developer and experimental version of some software).
	Clones are exactly clones of other projects that are made from remote to local repository.
	Forks are as "clones", but only in field of Github (when we clone one remote project to our account in Github, this is called as we make an Fork).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	In this case we can see the changes between remote commits, thus we can combine data and resolve conflicts.
