How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff help us to view the differences between files, so the amount of information for review is extremely small.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because any time you can roll back your changes in code, you can effectively see the changes that are made by other developers.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Advantage is that one manual commit is for one logical operation (for example one bug fixed), but if person forgetful than this is disadvantage and person needs autocommit system.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because commit in Git is snapshot of repository, while other VCS means commit for saving definite file only.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log" give us history of commits with commits id's than this id's can be used for "git diff" to see what changes were made in definite files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because any time you can roll back your changes to any state due to commits history.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For development
